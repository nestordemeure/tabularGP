# Examples

This folder illustrates tabularGP's functionalities with what aims to be exhaustive examples.
We cover:

- **[basic usage](https://github.com/nestordemeure/tabularGP/blob/master/examples/1_basic_usage.ipynb)** using a gaussian process for regression or classification (with uncertainty estimation)
- **[kernel selection](https://github.com/nestordemeure/tabularGP/blob/master/examples/2_kernel_selection.ipynb)** choosing an appropriate kernel to improve the fit and transfering knowledge from a task to another
- **[prior selection](https://github.com/nestordemeure/tabularGP/blob/master/examples/3_prior_selection.ipynb)** choosing an appropriate prior and using another model as a prior
- **[feature importance](https://github.com/nestordemeure/tabularGP/blob/master/examples/4_feature_importance.ipynb)** determining the features that matter to your model
- **[advanced usage](https://github.com/nestordemeure/tabularGP/blob/master/examples/5_advanced_usage.ipynb)** details the advanced parameters which can be used to further improve the fit

The examples presupose a familiarity with [fastai V1's tabular model](https://docs.fast.ai/tabular.html) interface as it is the basis for our API.
