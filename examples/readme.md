# Examples

This folder illustrates tabularGP's functionalities with what aims to be exhaustive examples.
We cover:

- **[basic usage](https://github.com/nestordemeure/tabularGP/blob/master/examples/1_basic_usage.ipynb)** using a gaussian process for regression or classification (with uncertainty estimation)
- **kernel selection** choosing an appropriate kernel to improve the fit
- **feature importance** determining the features that matter to your model
- **advanced usage** details the use of some obscure parameters
- **transfer learning and prior selection** transfering domain knowledge from a task to another and using another model as a prior

The examples presupose a familiarity with [fastai V1's tabular model](https://docs.fast.ai/tabular.html) interface as it is the basis for our API.
