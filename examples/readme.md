# Examples

This folder illustrates tabularGP's functionalities with what aims to be exhaustive examples.
It presupose a familiarity with [fastai V1's tabular models](https://docs.fast.ai/tabular.html) interface as it is the basis for our API.

We cover:

- **basic usage** using a gaussian process for regression or classification
- **kernel selection** choosing an appropriate kernel to improve the fit
- **feature importance** determining the features that matter to your model
- **transfer learning** transfering domain knowledge from a task to another by sharing a kernel or using another model as a prior
